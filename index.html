                    are just looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of attention, settling for something much less than respect. I am convinced one of the best way to help any relationship grow is by showing respect.

                <p class="l-text">
                    I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect? Respect is showing someone extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to show them how highly they are valued.
